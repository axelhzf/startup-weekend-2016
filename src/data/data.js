        description: "Angelina Jolie has a strict diet regime. During Tomb Raider movie she trained to become a more athletic woman. She used to have a high protein diet, low carbohydrate meal to help her in building muscle. The film required her to be an athletic woman. Like all the Hollywood celebrities she consumes lots of protein, takes steamed vegetables, fruits and lots of water in her diet. They take a little amount of complex carbohydrate, enough to replenish the body with the required energy. These days celebrity trainers are forcing their celebrities to perform intense aerobic and anaerobic exercises that help in burning the fat quickly. She opts for a diet plan that includes fresh fruits. She avoids the use of red meat and wheat based food items. She also likes having raw salads in her meal.",
